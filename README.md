Test out this code: https://t-y-p-e.com/

A simple demo of typing app I'm working on. Front-end only.
Built using Create-React-App, functional components, useContext hooks for application state, and custom CSS for styling.

The full app will have user accounts, and additional features enabled, including custom, shareable training modes, global user stats/rankings, and more detailed stats in general. 
Those features have not been implemented quite yet because I am still running trials to determine what backend stack I want to use. Currently experimenting with AWS RDS database, with node server running LoopBack as the API.
